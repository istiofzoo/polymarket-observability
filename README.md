## 📊 Example Use Case

1. The bot detects a new **ETH > $4000 before June** event on Polymarket.
2. It fetches **historical volatility** for ETH and estimates a **47.5% probability**.
3. The market currently prices it at **38%**, giving a **+9.5% EV advantage**.
4. Using **Kelly Criterion**, it allocates **2.8%** of capital.
5. The bot automatically **places a bid**, monitors outcome, and **sells in profit** on volatility spikes.
